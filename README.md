**Soil Moisture Prediction System**

Overview:

This project aims to develop a soil moisture prediction system using machine learning techniques to assist farmers in optimizing irrigation practices and improving crop productivity. The system utilizes historical data on environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall to forecast soil moisture levels in agricultural fields. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the system provides accurate predictions and actionable insights for sustainable farming practices.

Features:

Data collection from meteorological stations, soil sensors, and remote sensing platforms.
Preprocessing of raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature engineering to extract relevant features and capture complex relationships.
Model development using regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
Model deployment for real-time or near-real-time soil moisture prediction.
User-friendly interface for stakeholders to access predictions and visualization tools.
